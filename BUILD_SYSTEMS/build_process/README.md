# Build Process

The process of converting the high level source code into
an executable **binary image**.

Five keys steps are involved:

- Pre-processing
- Compiling
- Assembling
- Linking
- Locating

```

### Prepocessor

- The pre-processor strips out comments from the input files.
- The pre-processor also evaluates preprocessor directives by
replacing lines that start with #

### Compiler

- The compiler converts the c code to the architecture specific
assembly code.

### Assembler

- The assembler converts the assembly code to object code.

### Linker

- The different object files that were generated by the assembler
gets converted into one relocatable file by the linker

### Locator

- Input files are relocatable file and linker script, then output
file are an executable file (.elf)
- The locator converts the relocatable program to an executable binary
- The linker script provides the locator with the required information
about the actual memory layout and then the locator performs the
conversion to produce a single executable binary file

Examples file formats: Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), Common Object
File Format (COFF), Intel Hex Recordm Motorola S Record (SREC), ARM Image
Format (AIF), Binary

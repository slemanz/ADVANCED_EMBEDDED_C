# Newlib

Newlib is a C standard library designed for embedded systems. It is a collection
of software from various sources, all under free software licenses.

Newlib is known for its portability and is often used in conjunction with GNU
cross-development toolchains. 

The idea of this readme is to document how to implement full linker script, makefile
linker scripts content to implement libc in microcontrollers ARM Cortex-M.

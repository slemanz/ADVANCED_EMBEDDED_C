### The Feedback Advantage vs. Debug-Later Programming

- **Debug-Later Programming (DLP)** follows a risky "code first, test later" approach
where mistakes may go undetected for weeks or months. By the time bugs surface,
they're buried under layers of dependent code, turning fixes into unpredictable
detective work. The longer a bug exists, the harder it is to diagnose, often
leading to cascading failures.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) flips this model by providing instant feedback.
Bugs are caught within minutes—not months—while the code context is fresh.
Failed tests pinpoint exactly where logic breaks, allowing quick fixes or
rollbacks. This transforms defects from costly surprises into preventable
mistakes, slashing to near zero. Where DLP institutionalizes technical debt, TDD
builds a safety net that keeps code reliable and maintainable.

TDD isn’t just testing, it’s shifting feedback left to stop bugs before they exist.

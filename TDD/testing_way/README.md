# Testing Your Way

### Completing the LED Driver Through Incremental TDD

We continue developing the LedDriver from where we left off: with a skeletal
structure, a defined interface, and three passing tests. The goal is to grow the
implementation incrementally, one test at a time, ensuring each step is verified
before moving forward. This steady rhythm is the essence of TDD.

The next test, TurnOnMultipleLeds, turns on LEDs 8 and 9 and expects virtualLeds
to be 0x180. This fails because the current implementation only handles a single
LED. The solution involves bit manipulation: *ledsAddress |= (1 << (ledNumber -
1));. However, an off-by-one error (shifting too much) causes failures in
existing tests. This error is caught immediately, demonstrating TDDâ€™s power to
detect issues early. Fixing it (subtracting 1 from ledNumber) restores
stability.

With tests passing, we refactor the bit manipulation into a helper function,
convertLedNumberToBit(), to improve readability. This follows the TDD cycle:
after making a test pass, we improve the code without changing behavior.

# State Pattern

- The state design pattern enables an object to change its
behavior based on its internal state.

- Instead of using large conditional statements (if-else or
switch-case) to handle different states, the State Pattern
encapsulates state-specific logic into separate functions
or structures.

- This approach promotes modularity, reduces complexity,
and improves code maintainability.

### Components

- **State (Interface):** declares common operations (e,g
handleEvent(), enter() and exit()) that each state must implement.
This abstraction allows the context to interact with the state
without knowing its concrete type.

- **Concrete States (IdleState, TransmitState, ErrorState):** these
modules implement the StateInterface with behavior specific to each
state. For example, in an embedded communication module:
    - IdleState: Might simply wait for an event.
    - TransmitState: initiates data transmission and manages the
    transmission process.
    - ErrorState: handles error conditions and performs revocery.

- **Context:** Represents the object whose behavior changes with its
state. It maintains a reference to the current state and delegates
requests to it. The `setState()` method changes the current state, and
`request()` is used to handle events by forwarding them to the current
state.

### Key Characteristics

- **Encapsulation of State Logic:** Each state is represented by a function
or structure, encapsulating all behavior associated with that state.

- **Dynamic Behavior:** The system can dynamically switch between states
at runtime.

- **Separation of Concerns:** The main object (context) delegates
state-specific behavior to state handlers, reducing complexity in the main logic.

- **Open/Closed Principle:** New states can be added without modifying existing
code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle of SOLID design.

# Strategy Pattern

- The Strategy design pattern defines a family of interchangeable
algorithms and encapsulates each one, enabling runtime selection
based on system requirements.

- In embedded systems, this pattern is crucial for manging varying
processing requirements, hardware constraints, and operational modes
while maintaining code clarity and flexibility.

### Key Goals

- **Decouple algorithms** from their usage context
- Enable runtime **algorithm swapping**
- **Simplify maintenance** of multiple algorithm variants

# Bit-Packed

Bit-packing is a critical optimization technique in embedded systems, where
memory constraints are a primary concern.

Efficient data storage is essential for reducing RAM usage, minimizing flash
storage requirements, and optimizing CPU processing speed.

| Advantage                 | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Memory Optimization       | Reduces RAM/ROM usage by efficiently storing values. |
| Data Compression          | Saves bandwidth in communication protocols (e.g., SPI, I2C). |
| Efficient I/O Storage     | Helps fit more sensor data in limited EEPROM or flash. |
| Faster Processing         | Reduces cache misses and improves CPU efficiency. |
| Low-Power Optimization    | Decreases memory access operations, saving energy. |
